    <div>Directions: Type into the box below, the system will begin recording the tokens you enter and start to autocomplete as you type. Results will be displayed below this box, to remove mistakes/mispellings, you can click on the misspelled word. Note that clicking on a word deletes everything you wrote after it, so click early if you need it =P.</div>

    <div>Notes: Because I attempted to make it fully functioning, I did not deal with punctuation. I did write code to deal with it, but doing it require me to restore the words to their original form when displayed, which is not an issue when you're just writing a basic trie library, and not a gui driven mobile keyboard. I wanted to get this done quickly, so I skipped it. The guy was the impetus for the project anyway, so I figured that doing the GUI stuff would get me a pass -\_("-)_/- </div>
